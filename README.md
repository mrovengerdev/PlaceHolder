# VCT Hackathon

## Description

(Name goes here) is a virtual assistant designed to help esports team managers create optimal team rosters for the video game “Valorant.” It assists by analyzing player stats, roles, preferences, and even popularity to form balanced teams, ensuring the right mix of agents and skills for competitive matches. The assistant streamlines roster management by suggesting lineups, tracking player availability, and offering recommendations based on performance data.

(Max) NOTE: I love the idea of it tracking player availability
